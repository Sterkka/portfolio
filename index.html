												  My visits to the field documented how workers improvise by delaying data entry, by using alternative technologies to report and by mainly prioritizing their physical work task.
												  This leads to interesting reporting habits, which were reported and analyzed in my Master's thesis.

													We converted a learning space within our faculty into a restaurant environment, and we hooked up and mounted the prototype.
													<br><br>
													In the first test we were evaluating the system's GUI, the cognitive load and validated parameters with different group sizes.
													We found out that the GUI should require more explicit text and animations and less active confirmations from the users.
													We also concluded that we should reduce the screen size to minimize cognitive load and better diffuze the LED light.
													<br><br>
													In the second test we further investigated mapping and representation of information in the GUI.
													We measured how succesful is the system in aiding people in locating a vacant table and used both control and experimental groups to do so.

											  <h5 class="featurette-heading">A consolidated town that strives for a sense of a community</h5>
											  <p class="lead">We headed over to Ylöjärvi to inquire about the sentiment of local citizens.
												  After attending a discussion in the town hall we chatted with local politicians and other political and social players.
												  We learned that the newly consolidated parts of town, which are located quite far from the center, have somewhat lower levels of accessibility to municipal services.
												  <br><br>
												  In the central part of town we asked locals to tell about their daily municipal life experiences and heard that despite the pleasant life, they lack a sense of cohesiveness.
												  This is mostly due to the geographical dispersement of residents, lack of hang-out spots and low quality of local services.

												We also published an online survey to understand the ups and downs of local life, especially in regards to the quality of municipal services.
												We aimed at understading the attitudes of residents towards mobile technology and other digital services.
												We wanted to learn whether or not a mobile application can constitute a viable platform for civilians and city officials alike.
												<br><br>
												The survey results have indicated that there is readiness for digitalizaion within the community.
												This in light of the inequality in access to municipal services and positive opinions about digitalization of local services.
												Further, social media has already played a part in bringing people together as it was a highly popular mean for discussion and exchange of information and goods.

												As we developed our concept the emphasis was put on bridging geographical gaps by bringing residents together.
												The digital prototype aimed at exemplifying how inhabitants can take part in decision making processes by answering polls and surveys, by initiating ideas and events and by reporting faults.
												Our prototype also incorporated a gamified feature to induce participation and motivate people to use the application.
												<br><br>
												The final prototype was used to demonstrate to decision makers the potential of a municipal digital experience in catering information and provide access to services digitally.
												The end result has received positive feedback from our partners and has also been licensed.
